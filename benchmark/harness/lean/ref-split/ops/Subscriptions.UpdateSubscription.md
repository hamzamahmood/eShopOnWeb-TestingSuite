### Description

<dl>
<dd>

Updates one or more attributes of a subscription.

## Update Subscription Payment Method

Change the card that your subscriber uses for their subscription. You can also use this method to change the expiration date of the card **if your gateway allows**.

Do not use real card information for testing. See the Sites articles that cover [testing your site setup](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24250712113165-Testing-Overview#testing-overview-0-0) for more details on testing in your sandbox.

Note that collecting and sending raw card details in production requires [PCI compliance](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24183956938381-PCI-Compliance#pci-compliance-0-0) on your end. If your business is not PCI compliant, use [Chargify.js](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/38163190843789-Chargify-js-Overview#chargify-js-overview-0-0) to collect credit card or bank account information.

> Note: Partial card updates for **Authorize.Net** are not allowed via this endpoint. The existing Payment Profile must be directly updated instead.

## Update Product

You also use this method to change the subscription to a different product by setting a new value for product_handle. A product change can be done in two different ways, **product change** or **delayed product change**.

### Product Change

You can change a subscription's product. The new payment amount is calculated and charged at the normal start of the next period. If you require complex product changes or prorated upgrades and downgrades instead, please see the documentation on [Migrating Subscription Products](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252069837581-Product-Changes-and-Migrations#product-changes-and-migrations-0-0).

To perform a product change, set either the `product_handle` or `product_id` attribute to that of a different product from the same site as the subscription. You can also change the price point by passing in either `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle` - otherwise the new product's default price point is used.

### Delayed Product Change

This method also changes the product and/or price point, and the new payment amount is calculated and charged at the normal start of the next period.

This method schedules the product change to happen automatically at the subscription’s next renewal date. To perform a delayed product change, set the `product_handle` attribute as you would in a regular product change, but also set the `product_change_delayed` attribute to `true`. No proration applies in this case.

You can also perform a delayed change to the price point by passing in either `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle`

> **Note:** To cancel a delayed product change, set `next_product_id` to an empty string.

## Billing Date Changes

You can update dates for a subscription.

### Regular Billing Date Changes

Send the `next_billing_at` to set the next billing date for the subscription. After that date passes and the subscription is processed, the following billing date will be set according to the subscription's product period.

> Note: If you pass an invalid date, the correct date is automatically set to the correct date. For example, if February 30 is passed, the next billing would be set to March 2nd in a non-leap year.

The server response will not return data under the key/value pair of `next_billing_at`. View the key/value pair of `current_period_ends_at` to verify that the `next_billing_at` date has been changed successfully.

### Calendar Billing and Snap Day Changes

For a subscription using Calendar Billing, setting the next billing date is a bit different. Send the `snap_day` attribute to change the calendar billing date for **a subscription using a product eligible for calendar billing**.

> Note: If you change the product associated with a subscription that contains a `snap_day` and immediately `READ/GET` the subscription data, it will still contain original `snap_day`. The `snap_day` will reset to null on the next billing cycle. This is because a product change is instantaneous and only affects the product associated with a subscription.
