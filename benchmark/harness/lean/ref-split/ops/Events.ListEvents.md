### Description

<dl>
<dd>

Lists events for a site.

## Events Intro

Advanced Billing Events include various activity that happens around a Site. This information is **especially** useful to track down issues that arise when subscriptions are not created due to errors.

Within the Advanced Billing UI, "Events" are referred to as "Site Activity".  Full documentation on how to view Events / Site Activity in the Advanced Billing UI can be located [here](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24250671733517-Site-Activity).

## List Events for a Site

This method will retrieve a list of events for a site. Use query string filters to narrow down results. You may use the `key` filter as part of your query string to narrow down results.

### Legacy Filters

The following keys are no longer supported.

+ `payment_failure_recreated`
+ `payment_success_recreated`
+ `renewal_failure_recreated`
+ `renewal_success_recreated`
+ `zferral_revenue_post_failure` - (Specific to the deprecated Zferral integration)
+ `zferral_revenue_post_success` - (Specific to the deprecated Zferral integration)

## Event Key
The event type is identified by the key property. You can check supported keys [here]($m/Event%20Key).

## Event Specific Data

Different event types may include additional data in `event_specific_data` property.
While some events share the same schema for `event_specific_data`, others may not include it at all.
For precise mappings from key to event_specific_data, refer to [Event]($m/Event).

### Example
Here’s an example event for the `subscription_product_change` event:

```
{
    "event": {
        "id": 351,
        "key": "subscription_product_change",
        "message": "Product changed on Marky Mark's subscription from 'Basic' to 'Pro'",
        "subscription_id": 205,
        "event_specific_data": {
            "new_product_id": 3,
            "previous_product_id": 2
        },
        "created_at": "2012-01-30T10:43:31-05:00"
    }
}
```

Here’s an example event for the `subscription_state_change` event:

```
 {
     "event": {
         "id": 353,
         "key": "subscription_state_change",
         "message": "State changed on Marky Mark's subscription to Pro from trialing to active",
         "subscription_id": 205,
         "event_specific_data": {
             "new_subscription_state": "active",
             "previous_subscription_state": "trialing"
         },
         "created_at": "2012-01-30T10:43:33-05:00"
     }
 }
```
