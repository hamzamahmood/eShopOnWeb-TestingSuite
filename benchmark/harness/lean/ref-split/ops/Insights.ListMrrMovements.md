### Description

<dl>
<dd>

Lists your site's MRR movements.

## Understanding MRR movements

This endpoint will aid in accessing your site's [MRR Report](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24285894587021-MRR-Analytics) data.

Whenever a subscription event occurs that causes your site's MRR to change (such as a signup or upgrade), we record an MRR movement. These records are accessible via the MRR Movements endpoint.

Each MRR Movement belongs to a subscription and contains a timestamp, category, and an amount. `line_items` represent the subscription's product configuration at the time of the movement.

### Plan & Usage Breakouts

In the MRR Report UI, we support a setting to [include or exclude](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24285894587021-MRR-Analytics#displaying-component-based-metered-usage-in-mrr) usage revenue. In the MRR APIs, responses include `plan` and `usage` breakouts.

Plan includes revenue from:
* Products
* Quantity-Based Components
* On/Off Components

Usage includes revenue from:
* Metered Components
* Prepaid Usage Components
