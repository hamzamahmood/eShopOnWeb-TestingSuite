### Description

<dl>
<dd>

This endpoint will allow you to create an ad hoc invoice.

### Basic Behavior

You can create a basic invoice by sending an array of line items to this endpoint. Each line item, at a minimum, must include a title, a quantity and a unit price. Example:

```json
{
  "invoice": {
    "line_items": [
      {
        "title": "A Product",
        "quantity": 12,
        "unit_price": "150.00"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Catalog items
Instead of creating custom products like in above example, You can pass existing items like products, components.

```json
{
  "invoice": {
    "line_items": [
      {
        "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
        "quantity": 2,
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


The price for each line item will be calculated as well as a total due amount for the invoice. Multiple line items can be sent.

### Line item types
When defining a line item, You can choose one of 3 types for a line item:
#### Custom item
As shown in the basic behavior example, You can pass `title` and `unit_price` for custom item.
#### Product id
Product handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with `product_id`. By default `unit_price` is taken from product's default price point, but can be overwritten by passing `unit_price` or `product_price_point_id`. If `product_id` is used, following fields cannot be used: `title`, `component_id`.
#### Component id
Component handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with `component_id`. If `component_id` is used, following fields cannot be used: `title`, `product_id`. By default `unit_price` is taken from product's default price point, but can be overwritten by passing `unit_price` or `price_point_id`. At this moment price points are supported only for quantity based, on/off and metered components. For prepaid and event based billing components `unit_price` is required.

### Coupons
When creating ad hoc invoice, new discounts can be applied in following way:

```json
{
  "invoice": {
    "line_items": [
      {
        "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ],
    "coupons": [
      {
        "code": "COUPONCODE",
        "percentage": 50.0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
If You want to use existing coupon for discount creation, only `code` and optional `product_family_id` is needed

```json
...
 "coupons": [
      {
        "code": "FREESETUP",
        "product_family_id": 1
      }
  ]
...
```

#### Using Coupon Subcodes
You can also use coupon subcodes to apply existing coupons with specific subcodes:

```json
...
 "coupons": [
      {
        "subcode": "SUB1",
        "product_family_id": 1
      }
  ]
...
```
**Important:** You cannot specify both `code` and `subcode` for the same coupon. Use either:
- `code` to apply a main coupon
- `subcode` to apply a specific coupon subcode

The API response will include both the main coupon code and the subcode used:

```json
...
 "coupons": [
      {
        "code": "MAIN123",
        "subcode": "SUB1",
        "product_family_id": 1,
        "percentage": 10,
        "description": "Special discount"
      }
  ]
...
```

### Coupon options
#### Code
Coupon `code` will be displayed on invoice discount section.
Coupon code can only contain uppercase letters, numbers, and allowed special characters.
Lowercase letters will be converted to uppercase. It can be used to select an existing coupon from the catalog, or as an ad hoc coupon when passed with `percentage` or `amount`.
#### Subcode
Coupon `subcode` allows you to apply existing coupons using their subcodes. When a subcode is used, the API response will include both the main coupon code and the specific subcode that was applied. Subcodes are case-insensitive and will be converted to uppercase automatically.
#### Percentage
Coupon `percentage` can take values from 0 to 100 and up to 4 decimal places. It cannot be used with `amount`. Only for ad hoc coupons, will be ignored if `code` is used to select an existing coupon from the catalog.
#### Amount
Coupon `amount` takes number value. It cannot be used with `percentage`. Used only when not matching existing coupon by `code`.
#### Description
Optional `description` will be displayed with coupon `code`. Used only when not matching existing coupon by `code`.
#### Product Family id
Optional `product_family_id` handle (with handle: prefix) or id is used to match existing coupon within site, when codes are not unique.
#### Compounding Strategy
Optional `compounding_strategy` for percentage coupons, can take values `compound` or `full-price`.

For amount coupons, discounts will be always calculated against the original item price, before other discounts are applied.

`compound` strategy:
Percentage-based discounts will be calculated against the remaining price, after prior discounts have been calculated. It is set by default.

`full-price` strategy:
Percentage-based discounts will always be calculated against the original item price, before other discounts are applied.

### Line Item Options

#### Period Date Range

A custom period date range can be defined for each line item with the `period_range_start` and `period_range_end` parameters. Dates must be sent in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
`period_range_end` must be greater or equal `period_range_start`.

#### Taxes

The `taxable` parameter can be sent as `true` if taxes should be calculated for a specific line item. For this to work, the site should be configured to use and calculate taxes. Further, if the site uses Avalara for tax calculations, a `tax_code` parameter should also be sent. For existing catalog items: products/components taxes cannot be overwritten.

#### Price Point
Price point handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with `price_point_id` for components with `component_id` or `product_price_point_id` for products with `product_id` parameter. If price point is passed `unit_price` cannot be used. It can be used only with catalog items products and components.

#### Description
Optional `description` parameter, it will overwrite default generated description for line item.

### Invoice Options

#### Issue Date

By default, invoices will be created with a issue date set to today in your site's time zone. The `issue_date` parameter can be sent to alter the default. Only today or dates in the past are accepted. This date is interpreted and validated in your site's time zone. The format for `issue_date` is `YYYY-MM-DD`.

#### Net Terms

By default, invoices will be created with a due date matching the date of invoice creation. If a different due date is desired, the `net_terms` parameter can be sent indicating the number of days in advance the due date should be.

#### Addresses

The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to override the site's defaults. Each address requires to send a `first_name` at a minimum in order to work. See below for the details on which parameters can be sent for each address object.

#### Memo and Payment Instructions

#### Status

By default, invoices will be created with open status. Possible alternative is `draft`.
