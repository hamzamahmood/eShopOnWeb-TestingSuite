<summary><code>Task&lt;SubscriptionPreviewResponse&gt; PreviewSubscription(CreateSubscriptionRequest? body, CancellationToken ct = default);</code></summary>

<dd>

### Description

<dl>
<dd>

Previews a subscription by POSTing the same JSON or XML as for a subscription creation.

The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are represented in each Subscriber's Summary.

A subscription will not be created by utilizing this endpoint; it is meant to serve as a prediction.

For more information, see our documentation [here](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252493695757-Subscriber-Interface-Overview).

## Taxable Subscriptions

This endpoint will preview taxes applicable to a purchase. In order for taxes to be previewed, the following conditions must be met:

+ Taxes must be configured on the subscription
+ The preview must be for the purchase of a taxable product or component, or combination of the two.
+ The subscription payload must contain a full billing or shipping address in order to calculate tax

For more information about creating taxable previews, see our documentation guide on how to create [taxable subscriptions.](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/24287012349325-Taxes)

You do **not** need to include a card number to generate tax information when you are previewing a subscription. However, when you actually want to create the subscription, you must include the credit card information if you want the billing address to be stored in Advanced Billing. The billing address and the credit card information are stored together within the payment profile object. Also, you may not send a billing address to Advanced Billing without payment profile information, as the address is stored on the card.

You can pass shipping and billing addresses and still decide not to calculate taxes. To do that, pass `skip_billing_manifest_taxes: true` attribute.

## Non-taxable Subscriptions

If you'd like to calculate subscriptions that do not include tax you may leave off the billing information.
